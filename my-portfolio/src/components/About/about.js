        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p className="subtitle">I'm a Software Engineering Technician Student at Centennial Colleges and I am proud to be Filipino.</p>
        <p>
          I enjoy taking complex problems and turning them into simple and beautiful interface designs. I also love the logic and structure of coding and always strive to write elegant and efficient code, whether it be HTML, CSS or jQuery.
        </p>
        <p>Also included in this portfolio are my resume, a vision statement briefly outlining my professional philosophies and beliefs, and a professional development plan highlighting my evolvement throughout my program and how I intend to continue to grow professionally</p>
        <p>
          When I'm not coding or pushing pixels, you'll find me in our house hanging out with my awesome husband while cooking and enjoy life together.
